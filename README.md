# 🚀 Welcome to the Ultimate Axiom Demo Adventure! 🎉

Hey there, fellow cloud voyager! 🌩️ Ready to dive into the mystical realms of AWS Lambda, CDK, and Axiom? You've come to the right place. Buckle up, because we're about to turn logs into legends! 📜✨

## What's This All About? 🤔

This project is your golden ticket to experiencing a **serverless data pipeline** that's more exciting than finding a mythical creature in your codebase. We've got:

- **AWS Lambda Functions**: Because who needs servers anyway?
- **AWS CDK (TypeScript)**: Infrastructure as code? More like infrastructure as *art*.
- **Axiom Integration**: Logging so good, it deserves its own fan club.

Together, these components form a symphony of cloud computing magic that'll make your logs sing and your dashboards dance. 🎶

## The Grand Tour 🗺️

### **1. The Producer Lambda Function 🐇**

- **Schedule**: Runs every minute (because patience is overrated).
- **Function**: Generates messages with random data and occasionally pretends to fail (for dramatic effect).
- **Logs**: Sends logs to Axiom, so you can relive every thrilling moment.

### **2. The SNS Topic 📣**

- Acts as our message megaphone, broadcasting the producer's messages to whoever's listening (spoiler: it's the SQS queue).

### **3. The SQS Queue 📬**

- Our trusty mailbox, holding messages for the client function like a squirrel hoarding nuts.

### **4. The Client Lambda Function 🐢**

- **Trigger**: Fires up when there's a message in the SQS queue (like a kid on Christmas morning).
- **Function**: Processes messages, occasionally throws a fit (simulated failures!), and logs everything to Axiom.
- **Logs**: Also sends logs to Axiom, because sharing is caring.

### **5. Axiom 📊**

- The all-seeing eye of logging and analytics.
- Helps you visualize trends, spot anomalies, and impress your boss with fancy charts.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

- **Node.js**: If you don't have it, are you even a developer?
- **AWS Account**: The playground where all this magic happens.
- **Axiom Account**: Your ticket to log enlightenment.

### Installation 🛠️

1. **Clone the Repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/axiom-demo.git
   cd axiom-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Credentials**:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

4. **Store Your Axiom API Key in AWS SSM Parameter Store**:

   ```bash
   aws ssm put-parameter --name "/axiom/api/key" --value "YOUR_AXIOM_API_KEY" --type "SecureString"
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_AXIOM_API_KEY` with your actual Axiom API key (no peeking!).

### Deployment 🚢

Time to let this bird fly:

```bash
npx cdk deploy
```

Grab a coffee ☕ and watch as AWS spins up more resources than a spider web.

## How It Works 🕹️

1. **Producer Function** wakes up every minute, decides whether to be a hero or throw an error (because life's more fun with surprises), and sends messages to the SNS topic.

2. **SNS Topic** shouts the message to the SQS queue (consent was given, don't worry).

3. **SQS Queue** holds onto the message tighter than you hold onto your last slice of pizza.

4. **Client Function** retrieves messages from the queue, processes them (or not, if it's feeling rebellious), and logs everything to Axiom.

5. **Axiom** collects all the logs like Pokémon, helping you monitor and analyze your application's every move.

## Useful Commands 💻

- **Build the Project**:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- **Watch for Changes**:

  ```bash
  npm run watch
  ```

- **Run Tests**:

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- **Deploy the Stack**:

  ```bash
  npx cdk deploy
  ```

- **Diff the Stack**:

  ```bash
  npx cdk diff
  ```

- **Synthesize the CloudFormation Template**:

  ```bash
  npx cdk synth
  ```

- **Destroy the Stack** (for when you need a clean slate):

  ```bash
  npx cdk destroy
  ```

## Pro Tips 🧐

- **Simulate More Chaos**: Increase `PRODUCER_COUNT` in the CDK stack to have multiple producers. More producers = more fun (and more logs).

- **Check Your Axiom Dashboards**: Marvel at the visualizations of your application's behavior. Bonus points if you spot the simulated failures!

- **Customize Messages**: Spice up the message content in the producer function. Add quotes, jokes, or secret messages to future you.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

- **Lambda Timeouts**: If your functions are timing out, consider increasing the timeout in the CDK stack (or tell them to hurry up).

- **Missing Logs in Axiom**: Double-check your Axiom API key in SSM Parameter Store and ensure the Axiom extension layer is properly attached.

- **Deployment Issues**: Sometimes, the cloud just needs a hug. Try `npx cdk synth` to see if there's an issue with your stack.

## Behind the Scenes 🎬

### **Tech Stack**:

- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions that do the heavy lifting (and the light lifting, they're not picky).

- **AWS CDK**: Infrastructure as code, so you can deploy resources with the power of TypeScript (and a bit of magic).

- **TypeScript**: Because adding types to JavaScript is like adding sprinkles to ice cream.

- **Axiom**: The logging and analytics platform that makes sense of the chaos.

### **Project Structure**:

- **`/src/lambda/producer.ts`**: Code for the producer function.

- **`/src/lambda/client.ts`**: Code for the client function.

- **`/lib/data-pipeline-stack.ts`**: The CDK stack that defines all the AWS resources.

- **`cdk.json`**: Tells the CDK how to run your app.
